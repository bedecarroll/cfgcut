This directory holds sample configuration files used by integration tests.

The `*/` subdirectories mirror dialect names (e.g. `cisco_ios`, `juniper_junos`).
Each directory keeps a `sample.conf` (or equivalent) with minimal, licence-compliant snippets;
expand these or add new files when growing test coverage.
